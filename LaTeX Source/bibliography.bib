abstract = {The rapid aging of the population occurred in recent years has encouraged the development of several solutions aimed to guarantee a healthy and safe lifestyle to the elderly. In this paper, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system has been designed in order to create better living conditions for older people. In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home. A remote reasoning system processes all collected data with the aim of generating appropriate events and alerts. The architecture was validated from a functional point of view through a proof-of-concept.},

abstract = {Continuous GPS tracking devices always suffer short battery life when used by caregivers to reduce the risk of wandering to dangerous areas by dementia patients. Currently the best existing tracker for dementia patients on the market only supports less than 10 hours battery life with a gigantic battery. It not only requires daily battery charging from patients/caregivers, but also becomes a very restrictive device. In this paper we inspected individual energy consumption of the components in a GPS tracker and proposed a novel energy efficient, small wristband by integrating the latest LoRa communication and GPS duty cycling technologies. We verify our prototype's communication distance and energy efficiency through extensive experiments in the real world. Our model and data show the GPS wristband is able to support up to 40 hours continuous GPS tracking with a frequent 60 seconds location update rate. Its range also spans 3km, effectively monitoring patient locations.},

abstract = {Dementia is an age-Associated impairment that could affect about 135 million people worldwide by the year 2050. People with dementia suffer from memory and orientation problems, which cause them to wander and get lost. Advances in technologies and connectivity can be leveraged to reduce the risk of unsafe wandering. In this paper, we present a survey of state-of-The-Art technologies and methodologies, which are used for tracking and detection of wandering behaviors. The survey provides a compilation of the most related works in the literature and commercial fields, discusses their aspects and limitations, with the aim to benefit future efforts in this domain. We found that several approaches exist to tackle the problem of wandering, where most of the reviewed works tend to focus on the technical side, rather than adopting a user-centric design. We also observe that the commercial systems are lagging behind the research efforts, which can have a great impact if wisely applied in real world applications. Finally, we review the related sides of security, privacy and ethical concerns around the development of tracking systems, and present general recommendations for developing systems that respect these sides.},

abstract = {Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) are widely used in IoT applications as they offer low power consumption and long-range communication. LoRaWAN and SigFox have taken the top positions in the unlicensed ISM bands, while LTE-M and NB-IoT have emerged within cellular networks. We focus on unlicensed bands operation because of their availability for both private and public use with one's own infrastructure. New technologies have since been developed to overcome limitations of LoRaWAN and SigFox, based on LoRa or other modulation techniques, and are finding their way mainly into the industrial IoT. These include Symphony Link or Ingenu RPMA. To the best of our knowledge, previous works have not been focused on comparing LPWAN technologies in-depth including alternatives to the link and network layers over LoRa other than LoRaWAN. This paper provides a detailed comparative study of these technologies and potential application scenarios. We defend that LoRaWAN is the most suitable for small-scale or public deployments, while Symphony Link provides a robust solution for industrial environments. SigFox is one the most widely deployed networks; and RPMA has the advantage of using the 2.4GHz band, equally regulated in most countries.},

abstract = {Low power wide area (LPWA) networks are attracting a lot of attention primarily because of their ability to offer affordable connectivity to the low-power devices distributed over very large geographical areas. In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the current decade has led to the development of a multitude of new access technologies targeted at low-power, wide area networks (LP-WANs). However, this has also created another challenge pertaining to technology selection. This paper reviews the performance of LP-WAN technologies for IoT, including design choices and their implications. We consider Sigfox, LoRaWAN, WavIoT, random phase multiple access (RPMA), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as well as LTE-M and assess their performance in terms of signal propagation, coverage and energy conservation. The comparative analyses presented in this paper are based on available data sheets and simulation results. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate network performance in response to variations in system design parameters. Results show that each of RPMA, NB-IoT, and LTE-M incurs at least 9 dB additional path loss relative to Sigfox and LoRaWAN. This paper further reveals that with a 10{\%} improvement in receiver sensitivity, NB-IoT 882 MHz and LoRaWAN can increase coverage by up to 398{\%} and 142{\%}, respectively, without adverse effects on the energy requirements. Finally, extreme weather conditions can significantly reduce the active network life of LP-WANs. In particular, the results indicate that operating an IoT device in a temperature of -20 °C can shorten its life by about half; 53{\%} (WavIoT, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and RPMA) and 48{\%} in LTE-M compared with environmental temperature of 40 °C.},

abstract = {LoRa is the new communication technology under the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It emphasizes on the long-range communication with the high receiving sensitivity ability which allows it to work under the noise interference or noise floor effectively. The range of communication has become the critical part on most of the IoT system, especially in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-based IoT system. With the emergence of LoRa technology, further improvements to applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be realized. By using a single receiver in the LoRa network, it is able to handle many nodes at multiple locations within the area, unlike Wi-Fi-based system which needs to have many access points to increase the coverage area. The combination of LoRa and Wi-Fi technology reduces the cost of deployment of the IoT system. In this paper, the actual deployment of IoT system using LoRa technology with the combination of Wi-Fi technology. Besides, this paper presents the performance and the actual coverage area of the LoRa network in both the indoor and outdoor condition. For the indoor condition, a different set of LoRa parameter including Spreading Factor and Bandwidth is tested at different locations. As a result, the quality of the LoRa network does not only depend on the distance from the gateway but also the effect of path loss due to the structural element. Moreover, a single LoRa gateway located at the middle floor of the building is able to handle the LoRa end-devices at any location within the campus with Spreading Factor of 9. A better indoor coverage can be improved by adding an additional LoRa gateway in the campus. While for the outdoor condition, the maximum coverage area in the LoRa network for Spreading Factor of 12 is 330 meters with an indoor gateway deployment.},

Simultaneously, unlicensed low-power wide area networks are gaining momentum due to their low cost, low power, and long range characteristics, which are suitable for many IIoT applications, in addition to the usage of unlicensed bands. In this article, a solution is proposed to seamlessly integrate LoRaWAN, an open and standardized LPWAN technology, with 4G/5G mobile networks, thus allowing mobile network operators to reutilize their current infrastructures. This proposal is transparent to LoRaWAN end devices and to the EPC, since only the LoRaWAN gateway needs to be modified. The gateway acts as an evolved Node B from the core network perspective, implementing part of the eNB protocol stack. All data packets transported over the core network are both encrypted and integrity protected, hence achieving end-Toend security. As a proof of concept, this solution has been implemented and validated with an open source EPC.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider positioning with observed-time-difference-of-arrival (OTDOA) for a device deployed in long-term-evolution (LTE) based narrow-band Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) systems. We propose an iterative expectation-maximization based successive interference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of residual frequency-offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of-arrival (ToA) of the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a low complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog circuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as 1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect ToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running the EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated for each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA resolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of time-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate such as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small search window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the refined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three cells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the position of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical simulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against impairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual FO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional ToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device.},

Sensor and actuator networks connect communication machines and devices so that they automatically transmit information, serving the growing demand for environmental data acquisition. The IEEE 802.11ah Task Group is working on a new standard to address the particular requirements of M2M networks: a large number of power-constrained stations; a long transmission range; small and infrequent data messages; low data rates; and a non-critical delay. This article explores the key features of this new standard, especially those related to the reduction of energy consumption in the medium access control layer. Given these requirements, a performance assessment of IEEE 802.11ah in four common M2M scenarios, i.e. agriculture monitoring, smart metering, industrial automation, and animal monitoring, is presented.},

Comparison of the main characteristics of the gps/glonass systems from the user's viewpoint is made. Proposals focused on the operations to be carried out to improve navigation determination accuracy for the users, provided with the combined equipment, are given. The data presented, received simultaneously on the user's glonass equipment and a gp- {\pounds}oo gps system, indicate that navigational determination accuracies of both systems are approximately equal. The key characteristics of 6-channel user facilities for civil aircraft and helicopters are presented. This equipment has been developed in the Institute of Space Device Engineering (ISDE) in accordance with a standard draft aring on the combined system. The principal directions of the accuracy characteristic of the glonass system updating are considered. It is suggested to use the quantum-optical measurements on the Etalon satellite, launched into glonass satellite orbit, so that ephemeris information can be improved. The questions concerning supplying the system integrity and differential corrections information are discussed. It is proposed to combine the global system of integrity signal generation and transmission with differential corrections for regional systems. The version of the information frame developed in ISDE and intended for transmission of this information to users via geostationary satellites by means of signals similar to gps/glonass, and without additional complication of user equipment, is presented here. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Royal Institute of Navigation.

This problem has been traditionally solved either by algebraic or numerical methods. An approach that avoids the direct algebrization of the problem is proposed here. Using constructive geometric arguments, a coordinate free formula containing a small number of Cayley-Menger determinants is derived. This formulation accommodates a more thorough investigation of the effects caused by all possible sources of error, including round-off errors, for the first time in this context. New formulas for the variance and bias of the unknown robot location estimation, due to station location and range measurements errors, are derived and analyzed. They are proved to be more tractable compared with previous ones, because all their terms have geometric meaning, allowing a simple analysis of their asymptotic behavior near singularities.},

abstract = {This paper presents an indoor positioning system (IPS) and motion tracking system for the elderly, who are staying alone. The system is able to track the elderly location based on the room that they are currently situated and recognizes whether the elderly is moving or sitting. A smart wearable device featuring MPU6050 motion sensor, BLE beacon and Raspberry Pi Zero W is developed. The sensory data from MPU6050 will be analyzed to study the type of motion and publish to MQTT server. For location tracking, multiple Raspberry Pi 3 are used as BLE beacon scanners to scan for the beacon and publish its signal strength to an MQTT server. The datasets for the indoor location and motion type have also been developed in this research work. Weka, a machine learning software is used to evaluate and determine the most suitable classifier. The machine learning technique was implemented in Python programming language using scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy and SciPy packages. The results are then pushed to an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for remote monitoring. The accuracy rate is 99{\%} for the location tracking and 99.97{\%} for motion recognition.},

abstract = {Because of the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things and location-based services, researchers are evaluating wireless positioning techniques, such as fingerprinting, on Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication. In order to evaluate fingerprinting in large outdoor environments, extensive, time-consuming measurement campaigns need to be conducted to create useful datasets. This paper presents three LPWAN datasets which are collected in large-scale urban and rural areas. The goal is to provide the research community with a tool to evaluate fingerprinting algorithms in large outdoor environments. During a period of three months, numerous mobile devices periodically obtained location data via a GPS receiver which was transmitted via a Sigfox or LoRaWAN message. Together with network information, this location data is stored in the appropriate LPWAN dataset. The first results of our basic fingerprinting implementation, which is also clarified in this paper, indicate a mean location estimation error of 214.58 m for the rural Sigfox dataset, 688.97 m for the urban Sigfox dataset and 398.40 m for the urban LoRaWAN dataset. In the future, we will enlarge our current datasets and use them to evaluate and optimize our fingerprinting methods. Also, we intend to collect additional datasets for Sigfox, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.},

abstract = {Dementia is highly prevalent among the older population. Most patients with dementia are admitted to an aged care facility due to wandering behaviour which tends to result in dangerous scenarios such as straying away from the facility and being seriously injured. Due to the decreasing availability of carers in aged care, there is a need to prioritise monitoring of patients that have a severe case of wondering. The challenge is to allow carers to monitor the status of such patients in terms of position localisation and motion behavioural status, in real-time. The long term behavioural analysis of such patients would allow carers to better manage such patients. Current indoor localisation technologies cannot provide the accuracy of location and motion to enable unobtrusive behavioural analysis. Our aim was to develop an indoor localisation and activity monitoring system for aged care workers to aid the prioritisation of surveillance to the patients with dementia. Our system used Radio Frequency tracking combined with motion and heading sensors to track a person. The motion and heading sensor information were incorporated into a human activity classification model to determine the characteristics of a patient's walking activity. We conducted a month-long trial of our localisation network and activity monitoring system in an aged care facility.},
